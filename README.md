Taskmaster

Taskmaster is a lightweight task management application built with Node.js, React, GraphQL, and TypeScript — now enhanced with MongoDB for persistent storage.

This project serves as a full-stack example that demonstrates how these technologies work together to create a responsive, type-safe, and scalable task management tool.
